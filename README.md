"# C-Labs" 
Low level programming in C. This includes all sorts of "tricks" that emphasizes the
power of low-level computing, as an aid to understanding computing systems in
depth:
1) Pointers to functions and their applications.
2) Self-modifying code and applications.
3) Binary files of various types: structure and processing.
4) Maintaining data structures in files (e.g. pointers to structures, Linux directories).
5) Object and executable files (demonstrated through ELF files).
6) Linking and Loading.
7) Using operating systems services (system calls):
8) Process control: creating and terminating processes, process control, signals. Will be
9) introduced by programming a simple shell.
10) System-level Input/Output: read, write files, file metadata, sharing files.
